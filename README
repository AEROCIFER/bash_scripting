# Bash Scripting Repository

This repository contains a collection of Bash scripts demonstrating various scripting techniques, utilities, and examples. It is designed for both beginners and intermediate users interested in learning or referencing Bash scripting.

## Contents

- **Basic loops and control structures**  
- **Client-server communication demos with netcat**  
- **Script examples with argument handling**  
- Other useful Bash utilities and snippets  

## Getting Started

To use any script, first ensure you have Bash and `nc` (netcat) installed on your system. The scripts are intended to run on Unix-like operating systems including Linux and macOS.

### How to run scripts

1. Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/AEROCIFER/bash_scripting.git
    cd bash_scripting

2. Make the script executable (if needed):
    chmod +x script_name.sh


3. Run the script:
    ./script_name.sh [arguments]


Adjust `[arguments]` based on each scriptâ€™s requirements.

## Example

A simple loop script might be run with:

./loop_demo.sh 10 3

    Where `10` is the number of iterations and `3` is a number to print each iteration.

## Features

- Handles script arguments with validation  
- Demonstrates different loop types (`for`, `while`, C-style)  
- Shows basic client-server interaction using Bash and netcat  
- Includes connection detection logic in server scripts
